->Correlation: 
	* Definition: Correlation measures the strength and direction of a linear 			      relationship between two variables.

->Concepts:
	* Strength of relationship: The correlation coefficient ranges from -1 to +1. A value 	  close to +1 implies a strong positive relationship. close to -1 implies a strong 	  negative relationship. And around 0 implies no linear relationship.
	* Direction of Relationship: Indicates whether the variable increase 			  together(positive) or as one increases, the other decreases(negative).

->Real-Life Use Cases:
	* Determining the relationships between consumer income and expenditure on luxury 	  items.
	* In finance, correlating different stock movements to diversity the portfolio.

->Correlation Matrix:
	-> Types of Correlation Coefficients:
		1) Pearson Correlation Coefficient: Measures the linear relationship between 	 					    two continuous variables. it assumes that 						    the variables follow a normal 							    distribution.
		2) Spearman's Rank Correlation Coefficient: A non-parametric measure of rank 							    correlation, assessing how well 							    the relationship between two 							    variables can be described using 							    a monotonic function.
		3) Kendall's Tau: Another rank-based correlation coefficient, often used for 				  data with a natural ordinal classification.

->Real-Life Use Cases:
	1) Finance: Correlation matrices are used to understand the relationships between 		    different stocks or financial instruments, aiding in portfolio 			    diversification.
	2) Marketing: Analyzing customer data to find correlations between different buying 		      behaviours.
	3) HealthCare: Studying correlations between different lifestyle factors and health 		       outcomes.
