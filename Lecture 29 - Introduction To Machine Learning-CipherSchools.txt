									      *****Introduction to ML*****

-> What is AI?
	* Simulation of human intelligence processes  by machines.
				   or
	* It is the ability for a computer to think and learn.

-> Terms used in AI
	* Learning
	* Reasoning
	* Self-Correction

-> Types of AI:
	* Weak AI
	* Strong AI

-> What is ML?
	* Machine Learning is the subset of AI that uses statistical methods to allow machines to improve their results with the amount of training data fed to it.

-> Uses of ML
	* Prediction
	* Classification

-> Human Learning:  Observations -> Learning -> Skills
-> Machine Learning:  Data -> Model/Prediction -> Predict

-> Supervised Learning:	
	* The data is labelled.

-> Unsupervised Learning:
	* The data is unlabelled.

-> Deep learning is subset of Machine Learning. Machine Learning is subset of Artificial Intelligence.

-> Artificial Intelligence: Any technique which enables computers to mimic human behaviour.

-> Machine Learning: AI technique that give computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed to do so.

-> Deep Learning: A subset of ML which makes the computation of multi-layer neural networks feasible.
