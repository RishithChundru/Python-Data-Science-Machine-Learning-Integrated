->Python:
	* It is a popular Programming language.
	* It was created by Guido van Rossum, and released in 1991.
	* it is used for:
		* web development
		* software development
		* mathematics
		* system scripting
		* data science.

->Why python?
	* Python works on different platforms((Windows, Mac, Linux, Raspberry Pi, etc).
	* Python has a simple syntax similar to the English Language.	
	* Python has syntax that allows developers to write programs with fewer lines than 	  some other programming languages.

->Variables:
	* Def: Variables in python are used to store data that can be referenced and 	 	  manipulated throughout the program. they act as placeholders for values.
	* use cases: Variables can be used to store user information in a registration form.
	  for examples, name, age, and height could store the respective details of user.

->Data Types:
	* Def: Data types specify the type of data that a variable can hold. Common data 	  types in python include integers, floats, strings, lists, tuples, dictionaries, and 	  Booleans.
	* Use cases: They are used to model different kinds of information. for example, a 	  dictionary can store user profiles in a social media application where keys are 	  profile attributes and values are corresponding data.

->Conditionals:
	* Def: Conditional statements in python(if, elif, else) are used to execute code 	  based on certain conditions.
	* Use cases: Conditionals can be used in an e-commerce application to provide 	 	  different pricing tiers based on user membership levels(e.g., standard, premium, 	  VIP).

->Loops:
	* Def: Loops are used to execute a block of code repeatedly. Python supports for and 	  while loops.
	* Use Cases: Loops can be used to process items in a list. For instance, in a 	 	  payroll system, a for loop could iterate through a list of employees and 		  calculate their salaries.
