->Hypothesis Testing:
	* Definition: It is a statistical method used to make decisions using data from a 		      sample. the goal is to determine whether there is enough evidence in 		      a sample of data to infer that a certain condition is true for the 		      entire population.
	* Steps in Hypothesis Testing:
		1) State the hypothesis:
			* Null Hypothesis(H0): There is no effect or difference and it 						       represents a statement of "no change" or "no 					       difference".
			* Alternative Hypothesis(H1 or Ha): Contradicts the null hypothesis							    and represents a statement of 							    "there is an effect" or "there 							    is a difference".

->Steps in Hypothesis Testing:
	1) State the Hypothesis
	2) Choose a Significance Level
	3) Collect Data and compute a Test Statistic
	4) Determine the P-Value
	5) Make a Decision.

->Types of tests:
	1) Z-test -> Large sample sizes
	2) T-test -> Smaller sample sizes
	3) ANOVA -> 3 or more mu
	4) Chi-square test ->  categorical variables

->Scenario:
	* A basketball coach claims that his team scores more than 50 points on average per 	  game over a season. we want to test this claim based on the scores from 5 randomly 	  selected games.
->Hypothesis:
	* Null Hypothesis(H0): The team's average score per game is 50 points.
	* Alternative Hypothesis(H1): The team's average score per game is more than 50 	  points.
->Sample Data:
	* Let's assume the team scored the following points in 5 games:
	  53,47,52,55,49
->Steps in Hypothesis Testing:
	* x=(53+47+52+55+49)/5 = 51.2
2)State the hypothesis:
	* H0: mu=50
	* H1: mu>50
3)Comparison:
	* Compare the sample mean (51.2) with the hypothesized mean(50)
4)Make a decision:
	* If the sample mean is greater than the hypothesized mean, we lean towards 	 	  rejecting the null hypothesis in favor of the alternative. In this simplified 	  example, we're not using a formal test statistic or calculating a p-value.
->Decision:
	* The sample mean of 5.2 is greater than 50. Based on this simple Comparison( and 	  ignoring the statistical rigor of error probabilities), we might conclude that 	  the evidence supports the coach's claim that the team scores more than 50 points 	  on average per game.

1) A/B Testing (Marketing and product development):
	* Example: An e-Commerce site may test two different homepage designs(A and B) to 		   see which one leads to higher sales. the null hypothesis(H0) might state 		   that there is no difference in sales between the two designs. while the 		   alternative Hypothesis(H1) might state that design B increases sales  	    	   compared to design A.

2) Medicine and healthcare:
	* Example: A new drug is developed to lower blood pressure. Researchers conduct a 		   clinical trial where one group receives the new drug and another 			   receives a placebo. The null hypothesis could be that the new drug has 		   no effect on blood pressure with the alternative being that it does have 		   an  effect.


-> Inferential Statistics:
	* Key Concepts:
		1) Population and sample:
			* Population: The entire group that you want to draw conclusions 				      about.
			* Sample: A subset of the population that is used to represent the 	  	  	  	  entire group.
		2) Estimation: 
			* Point Estimation: Involves using sample data to estimation an 					    unknown population parameter(e.g., population 					    mean or proportion).
			* Interval Estimation(Confidence Intervals): Instead of a single 								     point estimate, an 								     interval estimation 								     provides a range 									     within which the 									     parameter is expected 	 							     to lie, with a certain 								     degree of confidence 								     (typically 95% or 									     99%).
-> Common point Estimators:
	* Sample Mean as an estimator for the population mean(mu).
	* Sample proportion as an estimator for the population proportion(p).
	* Sample Variance as an estimator for the population variance.

->Example: If you have a sample of student's score from a class test, and you calculate the 	   average score from this sample, that average(sample mean) is a point estimate of 	   the population mean score. assuming the sample is representative of entire 		   class.

-> Components of confidence intervals:
	* Confidence level: Typically expressed as a percentage(e.g., 95% or 99%), the 		 		    confidence level indicates the probability that the confidence 			    interval computed from a sample contains the true population 		  	    parameter.
	* Margin of error: The range above and below the point estimate that the actual 	  	  	   parameter is expected to fall within.
