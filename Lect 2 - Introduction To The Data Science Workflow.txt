->Life Cycle of Data Science Project
	1)Understanding the project.
	2)Gathering the relevant data.
	3)Data preparation and EDA.
	4)Feature Engineering & Feature Extraction.
	5)Model Building & Deployment.

->Understanding the problem
	* Define the objectives clearly.
	* Determine how to measure the project's success.
	* Identify the problem type(e.g., classification, Regression).

->Gathering Relevant Data
	* Collect data from available sources.
	* Ensure data is relevant to the problem.
	* Consider the volume, variety, velocity, and veracity of the data.

->Data preparation & EDA(Exploratory Data Analysis)
	* Clean the data(handle missing values, remove duplicates).
	* Perform exploratory analysis to understand the data.
	* Normalize or scale the data if necessary.

->Feature Engineering & Feature Extraction
	* Create new features that can help improve model performance.
	* Reduce dimensionality if the feature space is too large.
	* Select the most important features to be used for modeling.

->Model Building & deployment
	* Choose appropriate algorithms and train models.
	* Validate model performance using cross-validation.
	* Deploy the model for real-time user or batch processing.
